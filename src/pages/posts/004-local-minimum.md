Well, it's been a little while since I've been back here writing, but been wanting to get some of these thoughts just for my own posterity if nothing else.  

The original title for this post was "Rock. Bottom.", an homage to SpongeBob taking an unexpected bus trip to where else? But I felt that was a little dramatic, despite how it felt at the time.

About ten months ago **I was laid off**. I've been lucky enough to not have too many terrible days in my life that I can remember, but this one is definitely up there.

I remember it like it was yesterday. A Thursday. My son had been born barely a month prior. My mother-in-law had passed not 10 days ago. We had been through a tumultuous spring and summer after my wife was rear-ended during her third trimester. We were driving home from the park after finally feeling like things would settle down.

A “Team Sync” had been conditionally put on my calendar for 30 mins from now, with the CEO as the meeting organizer. Since I was on paternity leave, I messaged him saying as such, but I could jump on if urgent. Turns out, it was urgent, but it wouldn’t get that far. A nice woman from Human Resources called to inform me of the news. I'd been laid off.

I immediately launched into protest. "I'm on paternity leave! Is that even legal?!"  
"It's legal so long as it's a mass firing," she calmly replied. My heart sank. My wife and kids were in the car with me, listening to their dad lose his job.

It took a day or two for everyone to get an alumni discord together, but it turns out that 75%+ of engineering had been laid off in a shock move to all of us. We'd been told 4 months prior that no further layoffs were planned after a 15% RIF.

We had to go home so that I could go absorb what had just happened. I went from being gainfully employed to seriously worried about paying bills in a literal instant.  Sure we could have liquidated investments if needed, so maybe all my stress was ultimately unwarranted, but that's not really a course of action that you want to take.

It's obviously hard to not fixate on anything but what had just happened. I was nearly silent at dinner if memory serves. Bedtime with the kids was a blur. (Parenting generally feels like a blur sometimes, so maybe this isn't earth-shattering)  But I eventually went to bed and boy was sleep the most impossible thing to come by for the next week. Considering my newborn was hardly a month old, this probably just compounded how bad everything felt at the time. I toiled in bed. Combing over LinkedIn job postings I might be suited for. Essentially to no avail. This was in the midst of a year-long cycle of layoffs in the tech industry, and there was a flood of candidates far more capable for every job that was seemingly out there.
